    <p>I'm Beth, a mom to two crazy cats and one very sweet dog. Being based in Slidell, Louisiana lets me spend time doing two things I love, seeing live music and kayaking around the bayou!</p>
    <p>I love to research and solve problems. I am experienced in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
    <p>My drive for problem solving and creative solutions are what led me to this industry. My knowledge gained through education and personal experience is what will lead me to help you solve your problems.</p>
